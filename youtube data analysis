YouTube Data Analysis Project
Overview:
This project aims to analyze YouTube data using Python scripting, including data collection via the YouTube Data API, storage in MongoDB, API integration, and data management using MongoDB and SQL.
Components:
1. Python Scripting: Python is used for scripting tasks including data collection, analysis, and visualization.
2. Data Collection with API Key: YouTube Data API is utilized for gathering various data points such as video details, channel statistics, comments, etc., requiring an API key for authentication.
3. MongoDB: MongoDB serves as the primary database for storing collected data. It offers flexibility and scalability for managing unstructured data efficiently.
4. API Integration: Various APIs may be integrated to complement YouTube data, enhancing analysis and insights.
5. Data Management: MongoDB facilitates efficient storage and retrieval of collected data, while SQL may be used for structured querying and data manipulation.

Usage:
1. Installation: Ensure Python and necessary libraries (e.g., pymongo, requests) are installed.
2. API Key: Acquire a YouTube Data API key from Google Developer Console.
3. Configuration: Set up MongoDB database connection and API integration as per requirements.
4. Data Collection: Execute Python scripts to fetch data from YouTube using the API key.
5. Data Storage: Store collected data in MongoDB for further analysis and processing.
6. Analysis: Perform analysis using Python scripts or external tools, leveraging MongoDB and other integrated APIs.
7. Visualization: Visualize insights using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.x(vs code)
- pymongo (for MongoDB interaction)
- requests (for API requests)
- [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)
- MongoDB
- postgres SQL
